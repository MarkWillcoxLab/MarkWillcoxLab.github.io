research: "My research focuses on advancing eye health through the development of novel antimicrobial strategies and the clinical evaluation of contact lenses. I have a strong interest in antimicrobial peptides and their role in combating antimicrobial resistance, with applications in ocular surface diseases. My work spans laboratory research, animal models, and human clinical trials, integrating cell culture studies with translational applications. In addition, I investigate dry eye disease, ocular surface health, and binocular vision to better understand the complex interactions affecting patient outcomes."
