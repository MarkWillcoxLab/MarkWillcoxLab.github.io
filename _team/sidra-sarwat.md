research: "My research focuses on understanding the nanoscale dynamics of the precorneal tear film in dry eye disease by developing and applying fluorescent silicon quantum dots (Si-QDs) as advanced bioimaging probes. By engineering Si-QDs with tailored surface chemistries, ranging from highly hydrophilic groups, I aim to selectively interrogate the interactions, residence time, and turnover of aqueous and lipid tear film layers. Using in vivo rabbit models, the project integrates realtime fluorescence imaging with biocompatibility assessment to quantify tear film stability, lipid layer dynamics, and ocular safety. This work seeks to bridge a critical gap between biochemical tear film alterations and clinical manifestations of dry eye disease, providing a novel nanotechnology based framework for mechanistic understanding and future diagnostic or therapeutic strategies."
